### Know your scope
When creating a new website, we want our it to run on [certain browsers](/Testing/Cross-Browser_Testing) and [certain devices](/Testing/Cross-Device_Testing). But since projects are different and you'll meet different requirements everytime. So the first thing you have to do, is to define the browsers and devices you want to support.


### Know your limits

* **Time**
Testing is often forgotten on a projects timeline and therefore often done in a rush. Plan enough time for testing and provide your Project Manager with a realistic estimation of how much time testing will take.

* **Scope** <br/>
Not every website needs to work on hundreds of devices. Figure out the main use case, and focus on fulfilling that audienceâ€™s requirements.


### Know the levels of support
To get ab better understanding of your scope you should think in the following levels of support:

**Support Level 1**
* All content must be readable
* All functionality must work
* Deviation from approved graphic design must be minimized.

**Support Level 2**
* All content must be readable.
* Navigation must work.
* Any degradation of your website's presentation must not obscure content

**Support Level 3**
* No support or testing is required

Using this specification allows you to exactly define your scope and level of support.

### Test early, test often

Testing is not a task that is only limited to happen at the end of your project timeline. Starting testing in an early stage and continuously run these tests will force you to make the right decisions early and therefore minimize the risk of going the wrong way. It minimizes frustration in fixing a bug on one browser and the next bug on the other.
