LOOP is using a [centralized password manager](https://thycotic.agentur-loop.com/SecretServer/) to manage and provide passwords for pages, servers, databases etc. When creating a project you probably create passwords on your own (e.g. CMS credentials) or you'll receive passwords from others (e.g. Server access, Database credentails).

### Save Passwords
To share these passwords with your teammates, you have to add these passwords to your password manager.
